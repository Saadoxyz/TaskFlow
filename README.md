#  Description:

**TaskFlow** is a visually engaging, fully responsive **one-page website** crafted using core web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This landing page is designed for a fictional task management app that helps individuals and teams organize their work efficiently. The design starts with a captivating **hero section** that features the app name, a compelling tagline, and a clear call-to-action button.

The site then smoothly transitions into a **features section**, highlighting three major app functionalities using icons and brief descriptions. This is followed by a **testimonials section** where satisfied users share their positive experiences with the app, adding trust and credibility. The **pricing section** lays out three clear tiers — Free, Pro, and Team — each with defined benefits and a styled button to encourage conversions.

Finally, the **footer** includes contact links and social media icons, rounding off the site with accessibility and modern branding. The entire site is enhanced with **scroll-based animations** using AOS.js (Animate On Scroll), offering a dynamic experience as each section elegantly appears while the user scrolls down.

**TaskFlow** is a perfect demonstration of clean layout design, responsive web development, semantic HTML structure, CSS transitions, and interactive JavaScript — all without the use of any frameworks like React.
